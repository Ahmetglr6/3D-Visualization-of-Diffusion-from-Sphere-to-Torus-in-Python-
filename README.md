Recent project where I implemented a simulation to visualize the diffusion of heat through a 3D shape, transitioning from a sphere to a torus. This project utilized Python and several powerful libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib, to model and analyze thermal dynamics.Including the geometric transformation aspect emphasizes not only the functional but also the structural changes in the models during the simulation. This comment adds depth to your presentation, appealing to those interested in both the physics and geometry involved in such simulations.
